# Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs)

Yes, you found a suitable clustering algorithm, but how do you evaluate the cluster partitions, to optimize the learning process?

There are more than 30 internal validity indices, proposed for clustering that measures good partitions based on compactness and separation. In this project, we share implementations of 20 of them shown in literature to be significantly better than the others.

In addition to sharing implementations with their test scripts, we show through experiments that a multi-objective metric approach better approximates evaluation with ground truth than single metrics.
